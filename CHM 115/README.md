# AI Wellness Coach

## Overview

The **AI Wellness Coach** project aims to leverage OpenAI's GPT models and other machine learning techniques to create a digital health coach that provides personalized wellness advice. The AI system will analyze health data, suggest lifestyle improvements, track progress, and offer guidance in areas such as exercise, sleep, mental health, and nutrition.

This project integrates cutting-edge AI technology with the goal of enhancing personal well-being, while maintaining privacy and security of health-related data.

## Features

- **Personalized Health Recommendations**: Uses data inputs to provide tailored fitness, nutrition, and mental health suggestions.
- **Data Tracking**: Enables tracking of daily health metrics such as sleep hours, water intake, calories consumed, etc.
- **Wellness Insights**: Provides insightful analytics on the userâ€™s health patterns over time.
- **Interactive Conversations**: Facilitates ongoing communication with the AI to answer health-related questions or concerns.

## Technologies Used

- **OpenAI API (GPT-3.5/4)**: The core AI engine to process and generate personalized recommendations.
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for scripting the backend functionality.
- **Flask/FastAPI**: For building the web API that communicates between the frontend and AI backend.
- **SQLite/PostgreSQL**: Database for storing user data and health metrics.
- **JavaScript (React)**: For the front-end user interface, providing a user-friendly experience for interaction with the AI coach.
- **Docker**: To containerize the application for easier deployment across various environments.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.x**: [Download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Node.js**: [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Docker** (optional for deployment): [Download here](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

### Steps to Set Up

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai_wellness_coach.git
   cd ai_wellness_coach
   ```

2. **Install Python Dependencies**:
   Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   Then install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install JavaScript Dependencies**:
   Navigate to the frontend directory and install the JavaScript dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set Up Database**:
   If you're using SQLite (or PostgreSQL), make sure to set up the database by running the following commands:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate  # For Django projects
   ```

5. **Run the Application**:
   - **Backend (Flask/FastAPI)**:
     ```bash
     python app.py  # Or any equivalent command for your backend
     ```
   
   - **Frontend (React)**:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and add your OpenAI API key along with any other necessary credentials:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
DATABASE_URL=your-database-url
```

## How to Use

1. **Start the application**:
   Once both the backend and frontend servers are running, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (for React app) in your browser.

2. **Interacting with the AI Coach**:
   - After logging in or creating an account, enter your health data (e.g., sleep hours, exercise activity, food intake, etc.).
   - The AI will generate personalized recommendations and tips.
   - You can chat with the AI for further health-related advice.

3. **Tracking Progress**:
   - Use the dashboard to track your progress over time.
   - See your wellness metrics and review past suggestions from the AI.
